# **Detailed Notes on Threat Modeling in Secure Coding**

Threat modeling is a structured approach used to identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential security threats in a system. It is a critical part of the secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) and helps developers build systems that are secure by design.

## **1. What is Threat Modeling?**

### **Definition:**  
Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing potential security threats to a system. It involves understanding the system's architecture, identifying potential threats, and implementing mitigations.

### **Purpose:**  
- Proactively identify security risks.  
- Prioritize risks based on their impact and likelihood.  
- Design and implement security controls to mitigate risks.

### **Key Questions:**  
- What are we building?  
- What can go wrong?  
- What are we going to do about it?  
- Did we do a good job?

## **2. Why is Threat Modeling Important?**

- **Early Risk Identification:** Identify vulnerabilities during the design phase, reducing the cost of fixing issues later.  
- **Improved Security Posture:** Build security into the system from the ground up.  
- **Compliance:** Meet regulatory and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).  
- **Team Collaboration:** Encourages developers, architects, and security teams to work together.

## **3. Threat Modeling Process**

The threat modeling process typically involves the following steps:

### **Step 1: Define the Scope**  
- Identify the system or application to be modeled.  
- Define boundaries (e.g., components, interfaces, and trust levels).

### **Step 2: Create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**  
Visualize how data flows through the system. Identify:  
- **External Entities:** Users, third-party services.  
- **Processes:** Components that process data.  
- **Data Stores:** Databases, files, caches.  
- **Data Flows:** Movement of data between entities.

### **Step 3: Identify Threats**  
Use a structured approach to identify potential threats. Common methodologies include:  
- **STRIDE:** Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.  
- **PASTA:** Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.  
- **Attack Trees:** Hierarchical representation of potential attacks.

### **Step 4: Prioritize Threats**  
- Assess the likelihood and impact of each threat.  
- Use a risk rating system (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

### **Step 5: Mitigate Threats**  
Design and implement controls to address identified threats. Examples:  
- **Encryption:** For data confidentiality.  
- **Input validation:** To prevent injection attacks.  
- **Authentication and authorization:** For access control.

### **Step 6: Validate and Update**  
- Continuously validate the threat model as the system evolves.  
- Update the model to reflect changes in the system or new threats.

## **4. STRIDE Model for Threat Identification**

| **Threat** | **Description** | **Example** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Spoofing | Impersonating a user or system. | Using stolen credentials to log in as another user. |
| Tampering | Unauthorized modification of data. | Altering a database record or configuration file. |
| Repudiation | Denying an action occurred. | A user claims they didn’t make a transaction, and no logs exist. |
| Information Disclosure | Unauthorized access to sensitive data. | Exposing customer data through an insecure API. |
| Denial of Service | Making a system unavailable to users. | Overloading a server with requests to crash it. |
| Elevation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized access to higher privileges. | Exploiting a vulnerability to gain admin rights. |

## **6. Example: Threat Modeling for a Web Application**

### **Scenario:**  
A web application allows users to log in, upload files, and view reports.

### **Step 1: Define the Scope**  
- **Components:** User interface, authentication service, file storage, reporting module.  
- **Boundaries:** External users, internal admin panel.

### **Step 2: Create a Data Flow Diagram**  
- **External Entities:** User, Admin.  
- **Processes:** Authentication, File Upload, Report Generation.  
- **Data Stores:** User Database, File Storage, Report Cache.  
- **Data Flows:**  
  - User → Authentication → User Database  
  - User → File Upload → File Storage

### **Step 3: Identify Threats (Using STRIDE)**  
- **Spoofing:** Attackers could impersonate users.  
- **Tampering:** Attackers could modify uploaded files.  
- **Repudiation:** Users could deny uploading malicious files.  
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive files could be exposed.  
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could overload the file upload service.  
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Attackers could gain admin access.

### **Step 4: Prioritize Threats**  
- **High:** Information Disclosure, Elevation of Privilege.  
- **Medium:** Spoofing, Tampering.  
- **Low:** Repudiation, Denial of Service.

### **Step 5: Mitigate Threats**  
- **Spoofing:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication).  
- **Tampering:** Use file integrity checks and digital signatures.  
- **Repudiation:** Maintain audit logs for file uploads.  
- **Information Disclosure:** Encrypt sensitive files and enforce access controls.  
- **Denial of Service:** Implement rate limiting and input validation.  
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Use role-based access control (RBAC).

### **Step 6: Validate and Update**  
- Regularly review the threat model as new features are added.

## **7. Best Practices for Threat Modeling**

- **Start Early:** Integrate threat modeling into the design phase of the SDLC.  
- **Involve the Right Stakeholders:** Include developers, architects, security teams, and business owners.  
- **Keep It Simple:** Focus on high-risk areas and avoid overcomplicating the process.  
- **Use a Repeatable Process:** Standardize the threat modeling process for consistency.  
- **Document Everything:** Maintain clear documentation of threats, mitigations, and decisions.  
- **Continuously Improve:** Update the threat model as the system evolves and new threats emerge.

## **8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

- **Ignoring Low-Priority Threats:** Even low-risk threats can become critical if left unaddressed.  
- **Overlooking Dependencies:** Consider third-party libraries, APIs, and external systems.  
- **Focusing Only on Technical Threats:** Include human factors (e.g., social engineering) in the threat model.  
- **Not Validating Assumptions:** Verify that mitigations are effective and implemented correctly.

## **9. Conclusion**  

Threat modeling is a proactive approach to secure coding that helps identify and mitigate risks early in the development process. By following a structured methodology (e.g., STRIDE) and using appropriate tools, teams can build systems that are resilient to attacks. Regularly updating the threat model ensures that the system remains secure as it evolves.
